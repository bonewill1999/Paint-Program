	Today     : Added icons to four items in the shapes, i don't know what the last item is... (B1)
	Obstacles : At first i had trouble getting the right size image for the icons, after many tries, i concluded 
				that 16 by 16 is the ideal size. Another problem I have is that I don't know how to get rid of all
				the text. Right now there is an icon and the name on the shape. Since PaintPanel "reads" the label
				and the finds out what to do, I don't know how to fix this.
